# Bioinformatics-laboratory-project

Conducting a bioinformatical research exploring the hypothesis that some genetic heterogeneity exists among different cells of the same planarian organism, by examining planarian's single-cell RNA sequencing data, and finding positions in genes sequences that demonstrate such heterogeneity among different cells. 

The work is fully elaborated in the file "Bioinformatics Laboratory Project - Michal Alayev.pdf"

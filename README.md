# Bioinformatics Laboratory Project

Conducting a bioinformatical research exploring the hypothesis that some genetic heterogeneity exists among different cells of the same planarian organism, by examining planarian's single-cell RNA sequencing data, and finding positions in genes sequences that demonstrate such heterogeneity among different cells.\
The research required processing and examining extensive biological data, data wrangling, and creating various visualizations.\
It was conducted in Linux environment, implemented with Python, R, and Linux shell scripts, using Pandas, matplotlib and biopython.
